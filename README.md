# PeriodicDropperMod

Periodic Dropper Mod is a Minecraft mod that adds ... Periodic Droppers !  
But what are those ?

Simply put, they are resource generators.  
In a more complex way, they are also resource generators. But they create resource from a mystic power that 
no one is able to understand in our world. More than that, their drops depend on their *level* and their *core*.

Because yeah ! Without a core, a Periodic Dropper cannot drop anything. Weirdo.  

Lastly, they are called Periodic Dropper because they loot in a periodic way. Well, it's periodic if you have luck.
Yeah, I know. The higher the level, the shortest the periods are and the highest is the luck to have a drop at the 
end of that said period.

However, don't ask me why, I won't be able to answer you. I didn't create those things. The mystic power did.

So, good luck, and have fun playing with them !

## How to play with the mod ?

As told earlier, this mod adds Periodic Droppers. Their drops depend on their *core*.  
Here are the cores I discovered :

- "**Planting Core**". It only drops things that can be planted like saplings, seeds or flowers.
- "**Redstone Core**". It only drops things related to redstone uses. Don't ask me more, 
I thought redstone was decorating powder until now.
- "**Submarine Core**". It only drops things related to seas and oceans. Maybe rivers too. Even fish !
- "**Animal Core**". It only drops things that can be obtained with animals. ~~A real zoo !~~
- "**Hostile Core**". It only drops things related to your enemies. Yeah, getting their hearts never was as easy 
as it is now.
- "**Mineral Core**". It only drops things that are mining drops. Like it wasn't even meaningful to mine in this world. Oh wait ...
- "**Builder Core**". It only drops things that our world's people usually use for building or decorating their property.
- "**Nether Core**". It only drops things you can find in this dangerous part of the world. Or is is a world itself ? 
I don't know.
- "**End Core**". It only drops things you can find ~~when you are dead and accepted in heaven~~ in this heavenly 
part of the world.

Each Periodic Dropper can only have one core, like you Steve can only have one heart. At least that's what I heard.  
So that means when a Periodic Dropper has its core, you can't change it. Only thing you can do is upgrade it to 
higher levels.

When you have a Periodic Dropper, don't think you will get rich straight after. They are kind of slow, 
and inefficient in early levels. Upgrade them to get better drops faster. But it will cost you a lot of resources.  
Be well-prepared.

## For developpers

This mod is in early developpement. So there are a lot of features to develop.  
If you want to help, go ahead,
but don't expect me to add your feature in the day as I insist on understanding and controlling what I do.
So please, with your code, give proper documentation. I'll try my best to add good documentation too, so if you find 
there is a lack of it somewhere, tell me, and I'll improve it as fast as possible.

If you are willing to integrate this mod in a modpack or with other mods but don't find tools you'd need 
in order to do it, ask me if it can be added. I'm not the kind of guy to say no for free.
By the way, configuration files are planned, as well as a lot of things. So it will come to life, 
just I don't know when. This could be something you help me with ? Who knows ?

I just hope everyone finds what he wants in this mod, so please have fun using it !

Use this mod as you want as long as you don't modify directly the code of it without my permission.
